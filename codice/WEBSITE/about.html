			<h2>Tommaso Redaelli</h2>
			<p>I am a young physicist who has a deep passion for trail running and biking. Although I began my athletic journey as a football player, a common pursuit for boys growing up in Italy during the 90s, I discovered trail running in early 2019 and have been captivated by this exhilarating outdoor activity ever since. When I'm not on the trails, I relax tackling complex physics equations, which provide a welcome distraction from my sporting pursuits. RUN PHYS</p>

			<h2>Sara Ratti</h2>
			<p>As a PhD, I often find myself struggling with the challenging interpersonal dynamics of the research world. To get rid of of my profession pressures, I practice sports, particularly volleyball. However, since relocating to Milan, I have taken up trail running (why not?). Although running may not always be enjoyable, I am captivated by the thrill of long-distance races at a fast pace. Personal life goals may not always move as quickly as one likes, but I found my equilibrium. RED FOX</p>
